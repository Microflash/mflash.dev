Currently, I'm a backend engineer on an Aviation product where I write microservices using [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot). Occasionally, I also contribute to my organization's design system.

In the past, I've worked on site reliability, frontend, and ETL projects, in Legal &amp; Compliance, Document Processing, and Banking &amp; Financial Services domains.

I'm adept at
- [Java](https://openjdk.java.net/) and [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot)
- Relational databases (mostly [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/) and [Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/database/))
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

From time to time, I also work on
- [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) and [Angular](https://angular.io/)
- [Vuepress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/) and [Gridsome](https://gridsome.org/)
- CSS, [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) and [Stylus](https://stylus-lang.com/)
- [Groovy](https://groovy-lang.org/) (mostly with [Spock](https://github.com/spockframework/spock) and [Gradle](https://gradle.org/))
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io/)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)

I read a fair amount of science fiction and fantasy books. I frequently draw vector icons and illustrations. More often than not, I also hunt for interesting typography and new tools that improve my learning process, recollection, and productivity.

### About this site

This site began as a pet project while I was learning [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) and [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/). It helped me get my bearing around the Vue.js community, accessibility, web performance, and more.

Most of the posts here use a tutorial-style format to document a concept or process for my colleagues, peers, and myself. They serve as a reference for what I've learned, a source of amusement when I look back at them six months later, and a wellspring of ~~criticism and scorn~~ constructive feedback.

:::warning
Please treat the code samples as a demonstration of the topic under discussion. They are **optimized for learning** and **not for use in production codebase**. Please seek out the advice of your peers before using them in an existing application.
