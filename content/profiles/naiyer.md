Currently, I'm a backend engineer on an Aviation product where I write microservices using [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot). From time to time, I also contribute to my organization's design system.

In the past, I worked on site reliability, frontend, and ETL projects solving problems for the products in Legal &amp; Compliance, Document Processing, and Banking &amp; Financial Services domains.

I'm most experienced on
- [Java](https://openjdk.java.net/) and [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot)
- Relational databases (mostly [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/) and [Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/database/))
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

However, I've also worked reasonably often on
- [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) and [Angular](https://angular.io/)
- [Vuepress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/) and [Gridsome](https://gridsome.org/)
- CSS, [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) and [Stylus](https://stylus-lang.com/)
- [Groovy](https://groovy-lang.org/) (mostly with [Spock](https://github.com/spockframework/spock) and [Gradle](https://gradle.org/))
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io/)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)

Reading, mainly science fiction, fantasy, and manga, is my passion. I also like to draw vector icons and illustrations; the logo of this site, and the illustrations and several icons used on it were drawn by me. I'm a sucker for beautiful typography and new tools that improve my learning process, recollection, and productivity.

### About this site

This site began as a pet project while I was learning [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) and [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/). It helped me get my bearing around the Vue.js community, accessibility, web performance, and more.

Most of the posts here use a tutorial-style format to document a concept or process for my colleagues, peers, and myself. They serve as a reference for what I've learned, and a source of ~~criticism and scorn~~ constructive feedback.

Please treat the code samples as a demonstration of the topic under discussion. They are **optimized for learning** and **not for use in the production codebase**. Discuss with your peers before using them in an existing application.
