### About this site

This site began as a pet project while I was learning [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) and [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/). It helped me get my bearing around Vue.js community, accessibility, web performance and more.

Most of the posts here use a tutorial-style format to document a concept or process for my colleagues, peers and myself. They serve as a reference of what I've learned, and a source of ~~criticism and scorn~~ constructive feedback. 

:::warning
Please treat the code samples as a reference and demonstration of the topic under discussion. They are **optimized for learning** and **not for use in production codebase**. Please seek out the advice of your peers before using them in an existing application.
