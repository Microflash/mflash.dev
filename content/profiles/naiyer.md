I love to draw vector illustrations and have an avid interest in typography. I spend a lot of time hunting for good science fiction and fantasy books and reading them while commuting, after office and at random intervals during the day. I regularly explore new tools that improve my productivity and enhance my cache of knowledge.

### About this site

This site began as a pet project while I was learning [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) and [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/). It helped me get my bearing around Vue.js community, accessibility, web performance and more.

A lot of the posts here are tutorial-style notes that I'd documented to demonstrate a concept or process for my colleagues and myself. They serve as a reference of what I've learned, and a source to receive ~~criticism and scorn~~ constructive feedback. 

:::warning
The code described in the examples is meant for the demonstration of the topic under discussion; please apply caution and common sense before using it in an actual application.
