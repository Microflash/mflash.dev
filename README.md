# Microflash [![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/Microflash/microflash.github.io.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/Microflash/microflash.github.io)

Personal website of Naiyer Asif, made possible by:

- [Gridsome](https://gridsome.org/): a modern Vue.js framework for static websites
- [Gridsome Portfolio Starter](https://github.com/drehimself/gridsome-portfolio-starter): a simple portfolio starter for Gridsome
- [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/): a utility-first CSS framework
- [Fuse.js](https://fusejs.io/): a lightweight fuzzy-search library
- [Feather Icons](https://feathericons.com/): beautiful open-source icons
- [unDraw](https://undraw.co): a collection of beautiful svg images

The theme switching is done with the help of [custom CSS properties](https://alligator.io/css/theming-custom-properties/), the data is queried through [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) and the components and layouts are powered by [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/). The fonts are mostly system-native with the exception of `monospace` fonts where [Roboto Mono](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto+Mono) is preferred.

Continuous Integration is handled through [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/) and deployments are done with [gh-pages](https://github.com/tschaub/gh-pages). Graphics and illustrations are created using [Affinity Designer](https://affinity.serif.com/en-gb/designer/), [Microsoft Visio](https://products.office.com/en-in/visio/flowchart-software) and [Adobe XD](https://www.adobe.com/in/products/xd.html).
