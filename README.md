# Microflash [![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/Microflash/microflash.github.io.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/Microflash/microflash.github.io)

Personal website of Naiyer Asif built with:

- [Gridsome](https://gridsome.org/) - a modern Vue.js framework which generates this website
- [Gridsome Portfolio Starter](https://github.com/drehimself/gridsome-portfolio-starter) - which was the base for this website
- [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) - the CSS framework
- [Fuse.js](https://fusejs.io/) - which powers the search
- [Feather Icons](https://feathericons.com/) - for all the SVG icons
- [unDraw](https://undraw.co) - for the awesome SVG illustrations

The theme switching is done with the help of [custom CSS properties](https://alligator.io/css/theming-custom-properties/), the data is queried through [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) and the components are powered by [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/). The fonts are mostly system-native with the exception of `monospace` fonts where [Roboto Mono](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto+Mono) is preferred.

Continuous Integration is handled through [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/) and deployments are done with [gh-pages](https://github.com/tschaub/gh-pages). 

Graphics and illustrations are usually created by [Affinity Designer](https://affinity.serif.com/en-gb/designer/), [Microsoft Visio](https://products.office.com/en-in/visio/flowchart-software) and [Adobe XD](https://www.adobe.com/in/products/xd.html).
